# CHAPTER 2 — TWO MOTHERS, TWO FATHERS, TWO COVENANTS

Scripture’s structure becomes far clearer when Paul’s teaching in Galatians 4 is allowed to speak for itself. In that chapter, the apostle reveals one of the simplest and most important prophetic patterns in the Bible: two mothers, two covenants, two kinds of children, and two destinies.  
This pattern is not speculation. It is Paul’s own interpretation, given by the Holy Ghost, using Old Testament history to explain New Testament identity.

## I. Paul’s Key: “These Are the Two Covenants”

Galatians 4:22–26 presents one of the most direct uses of typology in the entire New Testament. Paul points to Abraham’s two sons—one born of Hagar and one born of Sarah—and declares:

**“Which things are an allegory:  
for these are the two covenants…”  
— Galatians 4:24**

According to the apostle:

- Hagar represents the covenant of bondage. “…Hagar, which gendereth to bondage, is Mount Sinai…”
- Sarah represents the covenant of promise.
- Ishmael, born “after the flesh,” pictures those connected only to the earthly covenant.
- Isaac, born “by promise,” pictures those connected to the heavenly covenant.

Paul is not inventing a metaphor—he is revealing the spiritual structure behind a historical event.  
This pattern becomes a cornerstone for understanding the rest of Scripture, especially its prophetic structure.

## II. Two Mothers — Two Kinds of Children

In Paul’s explanation:

- A mother represents a covenant.  
  • Galatians 4:26  
  • Galatians 4:24  
  • Isaiah 54:1 (Paul uses this in Gal. 4:27)
- A child represents the people produced by that covenant.

Thus:

- The old covenant produces children of bondage (Gal. 4:24).
- The new covenant produces free children of promise (Gal. 4:28).

This does not negate the literal history; rather, it uncovers the spiritual meaning behind the historical event.

Paul’s use of the term “mother” aligns perfectly with the Old Testament language of “daughters,” where entire cities or peoples are described as the offspring of spiritual unions and covenant identities.

Although Paul emphasizes the mothers, Scripture as a whole also highlights the role of fathers in spiritual identity.

## III. Two Fathers — Identity and Lineage

While Paul focuses on the two mothers, Scripture consistently presents the concept of fatherhood as the source of identity and authority.

- Jesus told the Pharisees, “Ye are of your father the devil” (John 8:44), not in a biological sense, but in a spiritual sense.
- John 8:39 — “If ye were Abraham’s children…”
- Romans 4:11–12 — Abraham father of all who believe
- God calls Himself the “Father” of His people (Deut. 32:6; Jer. 31:9).

In Scripture:

- A father represents the source of authority and origin.
- A mother represents the covenant that shapes the offspring.
- Children represent the resulting people or spiritual condition.

Thus, the two lines in Galatians 4 are formed by both a father and a mother:

- Abraham + Sarah → Isaac (promise);
- Abraham + Hagar → Ishmael (bondage).

Two covenants, two identities, two spiritual outcomes.

## IV. Flesh and Spirit — The Central Division

Paul’s application of the story shows that the two children picture two kinds of spiritual people:

- Ishmael — born “after the flesh” (Gal. 4:29).
- Isaac — born “after the Spirit” and by promise (Gal. 4:28).

These distinctions existed in Israel long before the New Covenant (Num. 14; 1 Kings 19). Paul applies the same pattern spiritually.

This aligns with the entire biblical pattern seen in Chapter 1:

- The faithful vs. the unfaithful  
- The remnant vs. the majority  
- The spiritual seed vs. the natural seed  

The covenant determines the nature of the offspring.

## V. The Casting Out of the Bondwoman

Paul quotes Genesis 21:10, saying:

**“Cast out the bondwoman and her son…”**

Paul applies this event spiritually to the separation between the covenants (Gal. 4:30).

This Old Testament event becomes a prophetic picture of God’s separation between:

- the covenant of bondage, and  
- the covenant of promise.

Paul applies it directly:

- The children of the flesh cannot inherit with the children of promise (Gal. 4:30).
- Spiritual inheritance belongs only to the line of the heavenly covenant.

This establishes a critical prophetic truth:  
God’s plan always includes a separation between the two lines.

## VI. The Heavenly Jerusalem — The True Mother

Paul concludes with a remarkable statement:

**“Jerusalem which is above is free,  
which is the mother of us all.”  
— Gal. 4:26**

Paul refers to the heavenly Jerusalem in a present spiritual sense, not merely the future city.

‘Jerusalem which is above’ is explicitly contrasted with the earthly Jerusalem in bondage (Gal. 4:25).

This identifies:

- The New Covenant with  
- The heavenly Jerusalem, which produces  
- The children of promise, who are born of the Spirit.

This heavenly mother stands in contrast to the earthly Jerusalem bound under the old covenant (Gal. 4:25).

This division between earthly and heavenly, flesh and Spirit, bondage and promise, becomes one of the major patterns traced throughout this book.

## VII. Summary — The Pattern That Shapes Prophecy

Paul’s teaching in Galatians 4 establishes the governing formula for covenant identity:

- Mother = Covenant  
- Father = Authority / Source  
- Children = People produced by that covenant  
- Outcome = Destiny (bondage or promise)

This is the Bible’s own interpretive structure, not a system imposed on the text.

From this simple division flow many of the prophetic patterns found in the rest of Scripture:

- faithful vs. unfaithful,  
- Spirit-born vs. flesh-born,  
- heavenly vs. earthly,  
- remnant vs. apostate lines,  
- the prophetic “daughters” that appear throughout the Old Testament.  
- Genesis 25:23 — “two nations… two manner of people…”

Understanding these two mothers prepares the reader to recognize how covenant identity shapes nations, eras, churches, and prophetic outcomes.

The rest of this book builds on the pattern revealed here—always returning to Paul’s declaration:

**“These are the two covenants.”  
— Galatians 4:24**

What follows is not a new doctrine, but the unfolding of a pattern God Himself set in Scripture.
