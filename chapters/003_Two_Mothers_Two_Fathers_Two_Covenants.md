# CHAPTER 2 — TWO MOTHERS, TWO FATHERS, TWO COVENANTS
The structure of Scripture becomes far clearer when Paul’s teaching in Galatians 4 is allowed to speak for itself. In that passage, the apostle reveals one of the most foundational prophetic patterns in the Bible: two mothers, two covenants, two kinds of children, and two destinies. This is not conjecture or later theology. It is Paul’s own interpretation, given by the Holy Ghost, using Old Testament history to explain spiritual identity under the New Covenant.

# I. Paul’s Key: “These Are the Two Covenants”
Galatians 4:22–26 contains one of the most direct uses of typology in the New Testament. Paul refers to Abraham’s two sons—one born of Hagar and one born of Sarah—and makes a decisive statement:
“Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants…” — Galatians 4:24
According to the apostle’s explanation:

- Hagar represents the covenant of bondage: “Hagar… gendereth to bondage… Mount Sinai.”
- Sarah represents the covenant of promise.
- Ishmael, born “after the flesh,” represents those connected only to the earthly covenant.
- Isaac, born “by promise,” represents those connected to the heavenly covenant.
Paul is not inventing symbolism. He is revealing the spiritual structure underlying a real historical event. This pattern becomes a cornerstone for understanding the rest of Scripture, particularly its prophetic framework.

# II. Two Mothers — Two Kinds of Children
In Paul’s explanation, the mother represents the covenant itself:

- “Jerusalem which is above… is the mother of us all” (Gal. 4:26).
- “Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants” (Gal. 4:24).
- Isaiah 54:1, which Paul quotes in Galatians 4:27, reinforces this imagery.
The children represent the people produced by the covenant.
Accordingly:

- The old covenant produces children of bondage (Gal. 4:24).
- The new covenant produces children of promise and freedom (Gal. 4:28).
This does not diminish the literal history of Genesis. Rather, it reveals the spiritual meaning embedded within that history.
Paul’s use of maternal imagery aligns with the broader biblical language of “daughters,” in which cities and peoples are described as the offspring of covenant relationships. While Paul emphasizes the mothers, Scripture as a whole also highlights the role of fathers in determining identity.

# III. Two Fathers — Identity and Lineage
Although Galatians 4 centers on the mothers, Scripture consistently presents fatherhood as the source of authority and origin.
Jesus told the Pharisees, “Ye are of your father the devil” (John 8:44), not biologically, but spiritually. Paul writes, “If ye were Abraham’s children…” (John 8:39), and later explains that Abraham is the father of all who believe (Rom. 4:11–12). God Himself identifies as the Father of His people (Deut. 32:6; Jer. 31:9).
In biblical terms:

- A father represents authority and origin.
- A mother represents the covenant that shapes the offspring.
- Children represent the resulting people or spiritual condition.
Thus, the two lines in Galatians 4 are formed by both father and mother:

- Abraham and Sarah produce Isaac, the child of promise.
- Abraham and Hagar produce Ishmael, the child of bondage.
Two covenants. Two identities. Two outcomes.

# IV. Flesh and Spirit — The Central Division
Paul applies this pattern to distinguish between two kinds of spiritual people:

- Ishmael, born “after the flesh” (Gal. 4:29).
- Isaac, born “by promise” and “after the Spirit” (Gal. 4:28).
This division did not originate with the New Covenant. It existed within Israel long before Christ, as seen in the wilderness generation (Num. 14) and in Elijah’s day (1 Kings 19). Paul simply applies the same pattern spiritually.
This aligns with the broader biblical structure introduced in Chapter 1:

- faithful and unfaithful,
- remnant and majority,
- spiritual seed and natural seed.
The covenant determines the character of what it brings forth.

---

# V. The Casting Out of the Bondwoman
Paul then quotes Genesis 21:10:

- “Cast out the bondwoman and her son…”
He applies this event directly to the separation between the two covenants (Gal. 4:30). What occurred historically becomes a prophetic picture of a spiritual reality.
Paul’s conclusion is explicit:

- The children of the flesh cannot inherit with the children of promise.
- Spiritual inheritance belongs to the line of the heavenly covenant.
This establishes a critical prophetic truth: God’s redemptive plan always includes separation between the two lines.

# VI. The Heavenly Jerusalem — The True Mother
Paul concludes with a striking declaration:
“Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.” — Gal. 4:26
This heavenly Jerusalem is presented as a present spiritual reality, not merely a future city. It stands in direct contrast to the earthly Jerusalem described as being in bondage (Gal. 4:25).
Here Paul identifies:

- the New Covenant with
- the heavenly Jerusalem, which produces
- the children of promise, born of the Spirit.

This contrast between earthly and heavenly, flesh and Spirit, bondage and freedom becomes a major pattern traced throughout Scripture and developed further in the chapters ahead.

# VII. Summary — The Pattern That Shapes Prophecy
Galatians 4 provides Scripture’s own framework for covenant identity:

- Mother = Covenant
- Father = Authority and source
- Children = People produced by that covenant
- Outcome = Destiny (bondage or promise)

From this simple division flow many of the prophetic patterns found throughout the Bible:

- faithful and unfaithful lines,
- flesh-born and Spirit-born,
- earthly and heavenly,
- remnant and apostate,
- and the prophetic “daughters” of the Old Testament.
Genesis 25:23 summarizes the principle succinctly: “two nations… two manner of people…”
Understanding these two mothers prepares the reader to recognize how covenant identity shapes nations, eras, churches, and prophetic outcomes. Everything that follows in this study builds upon the pattern Paul declares:
“These are the two covenants.” — Galatians 4:24
What unfolds next is the consistent development of a structure God Himself embedded in Scripture.
