PREFACE

This study uses typology—the same method Scripture itself uses—to illuminate prophecy (Gal. 4:24; 1 Cor. 10:6, 11 Her 8:5). Every truth presented is anchored in the King James Bible. Where Scripture states something plainly, this book leaves it plain. Where Scripture uses patterns, this book follows those patterns as Scripture presents them. Nothing is added to the Word of God; this study only observes patterns Scripture already presents.

Throughout the Bible, God consistently uses physical things to illustrate spiritual realities Paul teaches that the histories of Israel were written “for ensamples” (1 Cor. 10:6), and that covenants, mothers, and children may also serve as “allegory” (Gal. 4:24). This book does not create new allegories—it simply observes the ones Scripture already provides and traces how those patterns appear again throughout the prophetic writings.

This work does not replace literal interpretation. The literal meaning of every passage stands untouched. Typology in Scripture does not cancel the plain sense; rather, it reveals structure beneath the surface—structure already present in the text. The goal of this book is to make that structure visible. 

For generations, many believers have studied prophecy in separate portions—Daniel in one place, Paul in another, Revelation in another. Yet Scripture is not fragmented. It is a single architecture, written by one Author, carried by one Spirit, revealing one unified plan. When the patterns of Scripture are allowed to speak together, they form a cohesive framework that spans from Genesis to Revelation.

This volume does not attempt to predict dates, develop new doctrines, or build a system outside the Bible. Its aim is simple: to let Scripture interpret Scripture. The patterns that emerge—fathers, daughters, covenants, metals, and spiritual “day and night”—are all drawn from the biblical record. They are presented as patterns, not as additions to the Word of God. Typology in this book never overrides literal interpretation nor creates new doctrine.

The reader will find that the prophetic books, when viewed through the lens of Scripture’s own typology, fit together with remarkable clarity. What seems complex becomes orderly. What appears scattered becomes unified. The Bible’s own internal structure rises to the surface.

This book is not the final authority,—the King James Bible is. This study is simply a map of the patterns that Scripture itself reveals.
