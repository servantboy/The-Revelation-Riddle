# PREFACE

Scripture presents prophecy through patterns. Throughout the Bible, God consistently communicates truth by recurring forms—covenants, families, inheritance, kingdoms, and spiritual eras. These patterns are woven into the text with purpose. When observed carefully, they reveal continuity and design across the entire canon.

Remarkably, the book of Revelation refers to twelve women, yet none of them function as literal women. Instead, Scripture employs feminine imagery to convey covenantal identity. In biblical thought, a woman represents a vessel that receives seed and brings forth offspring. Prophecy, therefore, is not only centered on events, but on lineage—what is produced,
perpetuated, and carried forward across generations. This is why Revelation repeatedly links women with offspring, kings, and nations. The faithfulness or unfaithfulness of the woman plays a decisive role in the character of what she brings forth, and Scripture invites the reader to observe this pattern carefully before attempting to identify its specific applications.

The prophets consistently describe history through typology. Paul affirms this method when he teaches that Israel’s history was written “for ensamples” (1 Corinthians 10:6), and that covenants, mothers, and children function as allegory within God’s redemptive plan (Galatians 4:24). These patterns are interpretive tools Scripture itself provides.

This study follows that biblical method. The plain sense of every passage remains intact, while typology allows the underlying structure of the text to come into view. Literal meaning and typological pattern do not compete with one another; they operate together, revealing order beneath the surface of the narrative.

For generations, prophecy has often been examined in separate portions—Daniel in one place, Paul in another, Revelation in another. Yet Scripture speaks with one voice. One design runs through many covenants. When Scripture is allowed to interpret Scripture, its internal coherence becomes visible.

The purpose of this study is to trace recurring biblical patterns and place them side by side, allowing the text to speak for itself and reveal the structure already present within God’s Word.
