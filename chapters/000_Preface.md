# PREFACE

Scripture does not present prophecy as a collection of isolated predictions. It presents prophecy through patterns. Across the Bible, God repeatedly uses recurring forms—covenants, families, inheritance, kingdoms, metals, and spiritual eras—to communicate truth. These patterns are not imposed on the text; they are embedded within it.

The prophets describe history through typology. Paul affirms this method when he teaches that Israel’s history was written “for ensamples” (1 Corinthians 10:6), and that covenants, mothers, and children may function as allegory within God’s redemptive plan (Galatians 4:24). These are not literary devices created by later interpreters. They are tools Scripture itself provides.

This study follows that biblical method. It does not alter the literal meaning of any passage, nor does it replace plain interpretation. The straightforward sense of the text remains intact. Typology does not compete with the literal; it reveals the structure that Scripture already contains beneath it.

For generations, prophecy has often been studied in fragments—Daniel in one place, Paul in another, Revelation in another. Yet Scripture is not fragmented. One voice speaks through many books. One design runs through many covenants. When Scripture is allowed to interpret Scripture, its structure becomes intelligible rather than scattered.

The purpose of this study is simply to trace recurring biblical patterns and place them side by side, allowing the text to speak for itself and reveal the structure already present within God’s Word.
