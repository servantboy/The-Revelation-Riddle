# PREFACE

This study uses typology—the same method Scripture itself employs—to illuminate prophecy (Gal. 4:24; 1 Cor. 10:6, 11; Heb. 8:5). Every observation presented is anchored in the King James Bible. Where Scripture speaks plainly, it is left plain. Where Scripture reveals patterns, those patterns are followed as Scripture presents them.

Throughout the Bible, God consistently uses physical realities to illustrate spiritual truth. Paul teaches that the histories of Israel were written “for ensamples” (1 Cor. 10:6), and that covenants, mothers, and children may function as allegory within God’s redemptive plan (Gal. 4:24). These patterns are not imposed on the text; they arise from the text itself and recur throughout the prophetic writings.

Literal interpretation remains foundational. The plain meaning of every passage stands intact. Typology does not replace the literal sense—it reveals the structure that Scripture already contains beneath it. This study seeks to make that structure visible.

For generations, prophecy has often been studied in isolated portions—Daniel in one place, Paul in another, Revelation in another. Yet Scripture is not fragmented. It is a single architecture, written by one Author, carried by one Spirit, and revealing one unified purpose. When Scripture’s patterns are read together, they form a coherent framework stretching from Genesis to Revelation.

The patterns traced in this study—fathers and daughters, covenants, metals, and spiritual “day and night”—are drawn directly from the biblical record. They are presented as patterns Scripture reveals, not as additions to the Word of God. Typology here serves understanding, not innovation.

When the prophetic books are read through the lens of Scripture’s own internal patterns, what appears complex becomes orderly, and what seems scattered becomes unified. The Bible’s structure begins to speak for itself.

The purpose of this study is simply to trace recurring biblical patterns and place them side by side, allowing the text to speak for itself and reveal the structure already present within God’s Word.
