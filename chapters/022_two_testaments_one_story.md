A Will in Place, but Not Yet in Force

Hebrews 9:16–17 reveals a profound truth about the two Testaments: a testament is only “of force” after the death of the testator. A will may be fully written, legally valid, and completely in place, yet it cannot distribute its inheritance until the one who authored it dies.

This principle helps explain the relationship between the Old Covenant and the New Testament.

1. The Law was in place, but not in force as a testament

From Moses to Christ, the Old Covenant functioned as a real and binding document. It exposed sin, condemned the guilty, and concluded “all under sin” (Gal. 3:22).  
Yet it could not grant the inheritance, for “it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins” (Heb. 10:4).  
A will may exist for years before the inheritance it promises can legally be given.  
So it was with the Law.

2. A testament requires the death of the Testator

Hebrews states plainly:

“Where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.”**  
— Hebrews 9:16

Only the death of the Testator places a testament into force.  
Christ identified Himself as that Testator when He held the cup and said:

“This is the new testament in my blood.”**  
— Luke 22:20

His death was the legal moment when the inheritance could finally be dispensed.

3. The Old Covenant prefigured the New Testament, but did not activate itself

The Law was sealed with “the blood of calves and of goats” (Heb. 9:19), but no testator died to activate it as a testament.  
It was a covenant in place—valid, binding, and condemning—but not a testament that could give life.  
Only Christ’s death brought a testament into force, for only He was both the Author and the Sacrifice.

4. Not all receive the inheritance

Just as a human will may name specific heirs while others receive nothing, the New Testament distributes its inheritance only to those who believe:

“that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.”
— Galatians 3:22

A testament excludes as well as includes.  
Those outside the promise do not receive the inheritance, even though the testament exists.

5. The cross marks the transition from Law to grace

At the death of Christ, the Testator, two things occurred simultaneously:

1. The Old Covenant was fulfilled and finished — “It is finished” (John 19:30).  
2. The New Testament was put into force — “a testament is of force after men are dead” (Heb. 9:17).

Thus men are no longer “under the law, but under grace” (Rom. 6:14), for the inheritance has been released.

A covenant may be in place without being in force, but a testament cannot take effect without the death of the Testator.  
The Law stood as a covenant that condemned; Christ’s death inaugurated the testament that saves.  
Only those named within the testament by faith receive the inheritance it secures.
