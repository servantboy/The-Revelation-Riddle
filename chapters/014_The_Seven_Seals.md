# CHAPTER 13 — THE SEVEN SEALS

## The Seals as the Promises of God

This chapter approaches the seven seals of Revelation not as random calamities, but as the covenant framework behind God’s dealings with the world. 
The seals themselves are not the outpouring of wrath; they are the unveiling of forces, promises, and conditions that have existed since the beginning, now brought into view before judgment fully falls.

---

## I. A SEAL — MEANING IN SCRIPTURE

Throughout Scripture, a seal signifies:

- promise and covenant
- identity and ownership
- inheritance and authorization
- preservation until an appointed time

Examples:

- “Ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.” (Eph. 1:13)
- “Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.” (2 Cor. 1:22)
- “Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.” (Isa. 8:16)
- “Seal the book.” (Dan. 12:4)
- “A book… sealed with seven seals.” (Rev. 5:1)

A seal does not create reality; it marks, preserves, and restrains it until God’s appointed time. The seven seals therefore fit naturally as the covenant framework of redemptive history.

---

## II. THE SEALS DO NOT ACT — THEY REVEAL

A critical observation governs the entire chapter:
The seals themselves do not perform the actions.  When a seal is opened, something already active is revealed.

- Seal 1 reveals a conqueror already going forth
- Seal 2 reveals peace being removed by a rider
- Seal 3 reveals scarcity being regulated
- Seal 4 reveals Death and Hell already at work
- Seal 5 reveals souls already slain
- Seal 6 reveals signs already ordained
- Seal 7 opens what contains the judgments to follow

The seals are disclosures, not disasters. They unveil covenant forces that have operated across history, now shown in prophetic order.

---

## III. THE SEVENTH SEAL — PROMISE OF FUTURE JUDGMENT

Revelation 8:1 records the opening of the seventh seal:

- silence in heaven
- no immediate plague
- the emergence of the seven trumpets

The structure is deliberate:

- Seals — covenant framework revealed
- Trumpets — warnings announced
- Vials — wrath poured out

The seventh seal confirms that the seals themselves are not the wrath, but the opening of the book that contains it.
This aligns with 2 Peter 3:9–10:  The Lord is longsuffering, not slack, delaying judgment until repentance is complete—yet judgment will surely come.

---

## IV. TWO SEALS TRANSCEND A SINGLE TIME PERIOD

Seal Four — Death and Hell
“His name… was Death, and Hell followed with him.” (Rev. 6:8)

Death has operated since Genesis 2–3. This seal reveals an ongoing condition, not a new event.

Seal Five — The Martyrs

Souls under the altar are already slain and cry, “How long?” (Rev. 6:9–10)
Jesus identifies righteous blood from Abel onward (Matt. 23:35). This seal reveals the historical company of the faithful slain across time.

---

## V. THE FOUR HORSEMEN AND ZECHARIAH

Zechariah 1 and 6 introduce colored horses before Revelation:

- Red
- White
- Black
- Grisled (pale)

“These are the four spirits of the heavens.” (Zech. 6:5)

The horsemen are spiritual forces, not isolated end-time inventions.

---

## VI. THE FOUR HORSEMEN AS COVENANT FORCES

SEAL 1 — THE WHITE HORSE

The Promise of the Messiah

- White symbolizes righteousness and victory
- Thunder accompanies the opening (God alone is announced with thunder)
- A crown is given
- He goes forth conquering and to conquer

Scripture only identifies one rider on a white horse by name: Christ (Rev. 19:11–16).

The bow corresponds consistently with covenant imagery (Gen. 9; Ezek. 1:28; Rev. 4:3). 
This seal represents the promise of redemption fulfilled in Christ.

---

## SEAL 2 — THE RED HORSE

Sin and Satan’s Dominion

- Peace is taken from the earth
- Men kill one another
- Power is given, not inherent

Like Job 1–2, Satan acts only within limits imposed by God. The sword represents deceit and violence, a counterfeit of the Word.

---

## SEAL 3 — THE BLACK HORSE

Measured Judgment

“A pair of balances in his hand…” (Rev. 6:5)

There are only two places in Scripture where balances are held by a man:

- Hosea 12:7 — the LORD
- Revelation 6:5 — the black horseman

Wheat and barley are measured and priced. 
Oil and wine are untouched.

The black horseman carries the balances, but the voice from the midst of the throne governs the judgment.

Judgment is therefore administered, not autonomous.

Daniel 5 confirms the pattern: weighed in the balances, then judgment follows. 

Yet Exodus 12:13 declares mercy when the blood is seen.

Justice is real.  Mercy is sovereign.

---

## SEAL 4 — THE PALE HORSE

Death and the Grave

Death follows sin immediately (Gen. 2:17; Rom. 5:12). 
The sequence is precise:

-Death enters
- Blood cries from the ground (Gen. 4:10)
- The cry for vindication follows (Seal 5)

---

# SEAL 5 — THE MARTYRS

The Promise of Vindication

The saints cry, “How long?” 
They are told to rest—judgment is still restrained.
This confirms the seals precede the outpouring of wrath.

---

## SEAL 6 — THE WARNING BEFORE WRATH

Cosmic disturbance.  Global terror.  Recognition of the Lamb’s coming wrath.
This mirrors:
- Noah’s flood
- The removal of restraint
- The transition from warning to judgment

Peter places the flood and the Day of the Lord side by side (2 Pet. 3).

---

## SEAL 7 — THE JUDGMENT RELEASED

Silence.  Then trumpets.  Then vials.
The framework is complete.

---

## VII. CONCLUSION — THE SEALS AS GOD’S COVENANT STORY

The seals tell one unified story:

- Redemption promised
- Sin resists
- Judgment measured
- Death reigns
- Blood cries out
- Warning given
- Judgment executed

They are not chaos. They are covenant.

The Lamb alone opens them because the seals contain His promises, declared from the beginning and fulfilled at the end.
