# CHAPTER 13 — THE SEVEN SEALS

## THE SEVEN SEALS — THE PROMISES OF GOD
This chapter views the seven seals of Revelation not as random calamities, but as the covenant framework behind God’s dealings with the world. In this interpretation, the seals themselves are not the judgments; they are the promises, forces, and structures God has already set in place, which are then brought into the open before the day of His wrath fully unfolds.

## 1. A SEAL — MEANING IN SCRIPTURE

Across the Bible, seals signify:
- Promise / Covenant  
- Identity  
- Ownership  
- Inheritance  
- Authorization  
- Protection  

Examples:  
- “…ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.” — Ephesians 1:13  
- “Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.” — 2 Corinthians 1:22  
- “Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.” — Isaiah 8:16  
- “Seal the book.” — Daniel 12:4  
- “A book… sealed with seven seals.” — Revelation 5:1  

The consistent biblical idea is that a seal:
- marks what belongs to God,  
- protects what God has reserved,  
- and holds something closed until His appointed time.  

In this light, the seven seals of Revelation naturally fit the pattern of God’s covenant arrangements being opened and revealed.

## 2. THE SEALS DO NOT ACT — THEY REVEAL

This is the key observation in this framework:  
**The seals themselves are not described as performing the actions.**  
When each seal is opened, we see something already at work.

- **Seal 1:** the rider conquers; the seal only reveals him.  
- **Seal 2:** peace is taken; the rider takes it.  
- **Seal 3:** food is measured; the voice speaks, the rider holds balances.  
- **Seal 4:** Death and Hell kill; the seal unveils them.  
- **Seal 5:** the souls are already slain when the seal opens.  
- **Seal 6:** signs appear in heaven and earth; the seal reveals them.  
- **Seal 7:** there is silence in heaven, and judgments proceed from what it contains.  

The seals are therefore disclosures, not disasters.  
They **unseal what God has already ordained** and bring into view forces and realities that have been present in redemptive history, now being shown in their prophetic order.

The seals function as the heavenly side of the same prophetic cycle described in the churches and metals—showing the covenant forces that span the same history.

## 3. THE SEVENTH SEAL SHOWS THE SEALS ARE NOT THEMSELVES JUDGMENTS

When the seventh seal is opened (Revelation 8:1):

- there is silence in heaven about the space of half an hour,  
- there is **no immediate plague named**,  
- and **out of this seal come the seven trumpets**.  

Then:

- out of the seventh trumpet come the seven vials (bowls) of wrath.

This layered structure may be summarized:

- **Seals** – hold and reveal the covenant framework and forces.  
- **Trumpets** – announce specific judgments.  
- **Vials** – are the judgments being poured out.  

Thus the seals themselves are not the wrath; they are the opening of the book that contains both the warnings and the judgments to follow.

---

## 4. TWO OF THE SEALS ARE CLEARLY NOT LIMITED TO FUTURE EVENTS

Two seals plainly deal with realities that span all of history:

### **Seal 4 — Death & Hell**
Revelation 6:8:  
“And his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him…”  
Death and Hell have operated since sin entered the world (Romans 5:12).

### **Seal 5 — The Martyrs**
Revelation 6:9–10 shows:
- souls under the altar,  
- already slain,  
- asking, “How long…?”  

Jesus connects all righteous blood from Abel onward (Matt. 23:35).  
Thus the martyrs represent the historical company of the faithful slain.

**At least two seals clearly reveal longstanding conditions, not newly appearing future forces.**

---

## 5. THE BIBLE IDENTIFIES THE FOUR HORSEMEN IN ZECHARIAH

Before Revelation 6, colored horses appear in Zechariah.

### **A. Zechariah 1**
Colors:
- red  
- speckled  
- white  

They “walk to and fro through the earth” (Zech. 1:10–11).

### **B. Zechariah 6**
Colors:
- white  
- red  
- black  
- grisled  

“These are the four **spirits of the heavens**…” (Zech. 6:5)

Thus, in this framework, the four horsemen of Revelation 6 correspond to the four spiritual forces first described in Zechariah.

---

# THE FOUR HORSEMEN — SPIRITUAL FORCES OF REDEMPTIVE HISTORY

## PAIR 1 — The Northern / Heavenly Pair (White + Black)

- **White** – righteousness, victory, Christ’s covenant conquest  
- **Black** – weighing, evaluating, divine judgment  

These correspond to the heavenly judicial functions.

## PAIR 2 — The Earthly Pair (Red + Pale)

- **Red** – sin, unrest, bloodshed, Satan’s dominion  
- **Pale** – death and the grave  

This matches the biblical chain:  
“Sin… bringeth forth death.”

---

# THE SEALS

## **SEAL #1 — THE WHITE HORSEMAN**  
**The Promise of Redemption — Christ the Conquering King**

Revelation 6:2 describes a white horse and a conquering rider.  
Revelation 19 identifies a white-horse rider as Christ.

In this reading, the rider of Revelation 6:2 symbolizes:

- Christ going forth covenantually,  
- conquering through redemption and the gospel.

---

## **SEAL #2 — THE RED HORSEMAN**  
**The Promise of the Counter-Force — Sin / Satan’s Dominion**

Revelation 6:4 describes:

- peace taken from the earth,  
- a great sword given,  
- unrest spreading.

This symbolizes the force of sin and Satan’s dominion already at work in the earth since the Fall.

---

## **SEAL #3 — THE BLACK HORSEMAN**  
**Measured Judgment — Justice that Spares the Redeemed**

Revelation 6:5–6 reveals:

- balances in the rider’s hand,  
- measured scarcity,  
- a command not to harm the oil and the wine.

This symbolizes divine justice operating with limits that protect the redeemed.

---

## **SEAL #4 — THE PALE HORSEMAN**  
**The Final Consequence — Death and the Grave**

Revelation 6:8 identifies the rider as **Death**, with **Hell** following.  
This expresses the inevitable outcome of sin.

---

## **SEAL #5 — THE MARTYRS**  
**The Promise of Vindication — “How Long, O Lord?”**

Revelation 6:9–11 shows:

- slain souls crying for justice,  
- judgment not yet begun in full,  
- a promise that vindication will come.

---

## **SEAL #6 — THE PROMISE OF COMING JUDGMENT**  
**The Universal Warning Before Wrath**

Revelation 6:12–17 displays:

- cosmic signs,  
- global fear,  
- acknowledgment that “the great day… is come.”

This is the worldwide warning before judgment actually begins.

Enoch’s typology and the sealing of Revelation 7 reinforce the idea of **deliverance before wrath**.

---

## **SEAL #7 — THE PROMISE OF JUDGMENT FULFILLED**

Revelation 8:1:  
silence in heaven,  
followed by the trumpets and vials.  

This marks the transition from warning to active judgment.

---

# CONCLUSION — THE SEALS AS GOD’S PROMISE FRAMEWORK

### The seals tell the whole covenant story:

1. **Redemption** — Christ goes forth.  
2. **Sin’s Dominion** — the adversary resists.  
3. **Justice** — God weighs and measures.  
4. **Death** — sin’s final wage.  
5. **Martyrs** — the righteous suffer.  
6. **Warning** — cosmic signs precede wrath.  
7. **Judgment** — the day of the Lord arrives.  

The seals are the **covenant blueprint** of redemptive history, opened before the judgments of God are poured out.
