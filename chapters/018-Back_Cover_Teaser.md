# BACK COVER TEASER — *The Revelation Riddle*

For generations, the Bible’s prophetic books have been treated like disconnected puzzles.  
• Daniel’s statue.  
• Jeremiah’s daughters.  
• Zechariah’s four spirits.  
• Revelation’s seven churches, seven seals, seven heads.  

Each taught separately.  
Each debated endlessly.  
Each explained in pieces.

But what if they were never meant to be separated?

What if every prophecy… every symbol… every pattern…  
was part of a single hidden structure, woven from Genesis to Revelation?

What if the daughters of the Old Testament,  
the metals of Daniel,  
the timeline of the seven churches,  
and the seals of Revelation  
were all designed to fit together in **one prophetic architecture**?

And what if Scripture itself—without theology, tradition, or modern interpretation—  
reveals exactly how these pieces align?

In *The Revelation Riddle*, these ancient patterns are simply allowed to speak:  
• Two mothers.  
• Two covenants.  
• Two kinds of children.  
• Seven fathers.  
• Seven daughters.  
• Seven metals.  
• Seven churches.  
• Seven seals.  
• Seven heads.  
• And the mysterious eighth.

Once the pattern is seen, every verse falls into place.  
Prophecy stops being a maze… and becomes a map.

This book does not speculate.  
It does not sensationalize.  
It does not borrow from commentaries or systems.  
It simply reads Scripture with Scripture—  
the way the prophets wrote it,  
the way the apostles taught it,  
and the way the early church understood it.

You may think you already know Daniel’s image.  
You may think you already know the seven churches.  
You may think you already understand Revelation 17.

But when the pieces are assembled…  
when the architecture emerges…  
you will see the story the Bible has been telling all along.

A story hidden in plain sight.  
A story that begins with a daughter…  
and ends with a King.

Open the book.  
Break the seals.  
Solve the riddle.

**Deuteronomy 29:29**  
*“The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.”*
