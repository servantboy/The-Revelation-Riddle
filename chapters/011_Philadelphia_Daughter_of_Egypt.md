# CHAPTER 10 — THE CHURCH OF PHILADELPHIA / THE DAUGHTER OF EGYPT
Revealing the Daughter of Egypt (The Church Age in Its Twilight Hour)

---

## I. FULL KJV TEXT — REVELATION 3:7–13

7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write;  
These things saith he that is holy,  
he that is true,  
he that hath the key of David,  
he that openeth, and no man shutteth;  
and shutteth, and no man openeth;  

8 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door,  
and no man can shut it:  
for thou hast a little strength,  
and hast kept my word,  
and hast not denied my name.  

9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan,  
which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie;  
behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet,  
and to know that I have loved thee.  

10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience,  
I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation,  
which shall come upon all the world,  
to try them that dwell upon the earth.  

11 Behold, I come quickly:  
hold that fast which thou hast,  
that no man take thy crown.  

12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God,  
and he shall go no more out:  
and I will write upon him the name of my God,  
and the name of the city of my God,  
which is new Jerusalem,  
which cometh down out of heaven from my God:  
and I will write upon him my new name.  

13 He that hath an ear,  
let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

## I. The Time of Day: Twilight — The Last Light Before Nightfall

Philadelphia lives in the final moments of Day Two—  
the last sliver of daylight before darkness overtakes the world.

This is twilight:

- the sun is low,
- clarity and confusion overlap,
- the faithful and the wavering stand side by side.

Philadelphia is faithful in a fading hour.  
This is the last generation that can obey Christ voluntarily.  
What comes after this age will force decisions under pressure, not freedom.

Twilight divides two groups:

- those who walk in the light,
- and those who drift toward the rising night.

Philadelphia stands in the light that remains.

## II. Christ’s Introduction: The Holy One with the Key of David

Christ reveals Himself to Philadelphia in terms lifted directly from Isaiah 22,  
aligning this tiny remnant with an ancient prophecy:

“These things saith he that is holy, he that is true,  
he that hath the key of David,  
he that openeth, and no man shutteth;  
and shutteth, and no man openeth.”

This is not a random title.  
This is Eliakim’s prophecy, fulfilled in Christ. 

---

## III. Isaiah 22 — The Prophetic Background of Philadelphia

Isaiah 22 describes two men:

2. Eliakim — the faithful steward  
humble, dependable, obedient,  
clothed by God and given authority.

Isaiah 22:20–22:  
“I will call my servant Eliakim…  
And I will clothe him with thy robe…  
and strengthen him with thy girdle…  
and I will commit thy government into his hand…  
and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder…”

Christ quotes this prophecy in Revelation 3:7 when addressing Philadelphia.  
This is deliberate.  
It reveals the spiritual reality:

✔ Laodicea is the Shebna-type —  
self-sufficient, blind, proud, and about to be removed from stewardship.  

✔ Philadelphia is the Eliakim-type —  
faithful, obedient, humble, entrusted with access and authority.

The relationship between Philadelphia and Laodicea  
is exactly the relationship between Eliakim and Shebna.

## IV. “Thou Hast Kept My Word, and Hast Not Denied My Name”

Christ identifies the remnant by two distinguishing marks:

1. They keep His Word.  
   They hold fast to Scripture in an age where most reinterpret it. In Acts chapter 17 it says the Bereans were more noble, “These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so”. They studied (trusted) the scriptures and questioned the teacher, even when the teacher was Paul. Today (Philadelphia time period), the “church” has a tendency to trust the teacher and question the scripture. 

2. They do not deny His Name.  
   They hold to His true identity while others trade it for cultural approval.

Their faithfulness is not described as dramatic or powerful:  
“thou hast a little strength”  

A “little strength” is not weakness—  
it is dependence.  
And dependence is what God honors.

---

## V. “I Have Set Before Thee an Open Door”

Because Philadelphia holds to the Word,  
Christ sets before them an open door—

“…and no man can shut it.”

This is the door that Eliakim’s key opened in Isaiah 22.  
It represents:

- deliverance,
- access,
- protection,
- reward,
- and escape from the coming hour.

This door is not opened by might,  
but by faithfulness.  
What Christ opens here,  
nothing on earth or in heaven can close.

Luke 13:23-30 (vs 24 “Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.”).

## VI. Laodicea Humbled Before the Faithful Remnant

The group Christ refers to in Philadelphia’s letter is often misunderstood.  
It is not a distant external synagogue being humbled —  
it is the unconverted church of the same generation:  
Laodicea.

Christ says of them:  
“Which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie.”

This is not ethnic identity.  
This is covenant identity —  
a claim to spiritual legitimacy and special standing before God  
while lacking obedience, humility, and spiritual sight.

Laodicea believes they are rich, blessed, and complete.  
Christ exposes them as:

- spiritually poor,
- blind,
- naked,
- self-deceived,
- and in desperate need of repentance.

And it is Laodicea whom Christ promises to humble before Philadelphia:

“Behold, I will make them come and worship before thy feet,  
and to know that I have loved thee.”

This does not mean Philadelphia is worshipped.  
It means Laodicea will finally acknowledge:

- the truth they resisted,
- the remnant they ignored,
- and the love Christ had for His faithful ones all along.

This humility precedes their later repentance under pressure —  
the beginning of their awakening as night falls.

## VII. Philadelphia and Laodicea Coexist in the Same Generation

This period—like the brass age where Pergamos and Thyatira coexisted—  
contains two churches at the same time,  
but with far sharper spiritual contrast.

**Philadelphia**

- humble
- awake
- obedient
- spiritually alive
- ready for removal

**Laodicea**

- lukewarm
- undecided
- self-deceived
- spiritually blind
- under conviction
- like the “men on the wall” Isaiah 36:12 “Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall”
- During the Philadelphia time period, Laodicea is on the wall (lukewarm).  

They inhabit the same twilight,  
but walk in opposite directions.

This dual-church reality is the final dividing line  
before the rapture and the Tribulation.

---

## VIII. “Because Thou Hast Kept the Word of My Patience…”

The remnant is defined by patience—  
not impatience, not self-reliance, not compromise.

They endure faithfully while the world loses its anchor.

And Christ responds:  
“I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation,  
which shall come upon all the world.”

This is not preservation through the hour.  
It is preservation from the hour.  
Philadelphia is removed  
before the night fully comes.

## IX. The Daughter of Egypt — Philadelphia’s Prophetic Contrast

Scripture presents the daughter of Egypt (Isa. 19; Jer. 46) as a people near to Israel yet outside the covenant—fearful, unstable, and dependent on human strength. This becomes the Old Testament pattern for the unconverted element standing beside Philadelphia at twilight.

Hebrews 11:24–26 reflects Philadelphia’s spirit, “By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.”. Moses refused Egypt’s identity, rejected its treasures, and chose affliction with the people of God. Egypt therefore represents a religion of worldly advantage, while Philadelphia represents faithfulness to the Word regardless of cost.

Israel’s physical history moved from bondage in Egypt to captivity in Babylon. Yet Israel was never truly delivered from Babylon; its captivity merely shifted from physical to spiritual, beginning a new era. In the Church Age this pattern reverses: spiritual decline begins under Babylon’s influence and concludes in an Egypt-like dependence on worldly security at twilight.

This makes Egypt the perfect prophetic background for Laodicea. Egypt’s wealth, confidence, and self-assurance mirror Laodicea’s boast, “I am rich, and increased with goods.” Egypt appears strong until the Lord shakes it; Laodicea appears blessed until Christ exposes her poverty.

This era is also marked by the rise of the prosperity gospel. The “name it and claim it” movement aligns perfectly with Egypt’s pattern:

- worldly increase mistaken for spiritual favor,
- material gain interpreted as divine approval,
- confidence placed in comfort rather than obedience.

It is the ideal deception for Laodicea: a religion that promises Egypt’s wealth without Egypt’s bondage, yet produces the same spiritual poverty.

Thus the Daughter of Egypt becomes Laodicea’s prophetic mirror:

- close to the people of God, but without covenant life;
- rich in appearance, poor in substance;
- confident in prosperity, yet trembling when the Lord arises.

Philadelphia, with “a little strength,” walks in the light of the Word.  
The Daughter of Egypt—Laodicea’s likeness—drifts toward the rising night.  
Twilight reveals the difference.

## X. “Hold Fast… That No Man Take Thy Crown”

Twilight is a moment of testing.  
The command is simple:

- hold fast to patience,
- hold fast to humility,
- hold fast to the Word.

The crown is not salvation—  
it is honor, reward, and authority  
for those who remain faithful in the final hour.

1 Timothy 4:8 “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”

---

## XI. The Reward: Pillars, Names, and Permanence

Christ promises Philadelphia:

1. A pillar in the temple of God  
   Stable. Permanent. Unshakable.

2. The name of God  
   True identity.

3. The name of the city of God (New Jerusalem)  
   True citizenship.

4. His new name  
   True relationship.

These are the blessings reserved for the faithful steward—  
the one who walks in the authority of the true Holder of the key of David.

The imagery of Isaiah 22 is complete:

- clothed with God’s robe,
- strengthened with His girdle,
- anchored in His house,
- established forever.

## XII. Summary: The Last Light of the Faithful

Philadelphia is:

- the faithful remnant,
- the obedient few,
- the ones who cling to the Word,
- the ones Christ openly loves,
- the last generation before the darkness,
- those who inherit the open door,
- the living reflection of Eliakim’s faithfulness,
- the people God preserves from the final hour.

While the majority drift into darkness,  
Philadelphia walks in the last rays of light.
