CHAPTER 14 — THE RAPTURE
This chapter does not attempt to invent new doctrine about the rapture; instead, it gathers what Scripture actually says(KJV) and then places the rapture inside the prophetic structure already laid out in this book: the two days, the seven churches, and the daughters.
The word “rapture” does not appear in the King James Bible, but the event does:
	•	1 Thessalonians 4:16–17 — “caught up together with them in the clouds”
	•	1 Corinthians 15:51–52 — “we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed”
This chapter asks: Where does that catching away stand in relation to the Church, Laodicea, and the Tribulation?

1. THE RAPTURE DOES NOT BY ITSELF END THE CHURCH AGE
A common teaching in modern prophecy preaching is:
	•	“When the Church is raptured, God goes back to dealing with Israel.”
	•	“The Church age ends at the rapture.”
The King James Bible, however, never says:
	•	“The Church age ends at the rapture,” or
	•	“After the rapture, God is finished dealing with all Gentile believers.”
What we can say from Scripture is this:
	•	There will be a catching away of living saints (1 Thess. 4:16–17).
	•	There will be a resurrection and change “in a moment” (1 Cor. 15:51–52).
	•	There will be a time when worship of the beast is enforced and refusal means death (Rev. 13:15–17).
In the prophetic framework of this study, the rapture marks a transition in how worship operates on earth:
	•	Before the rapture (Philadelphia & Laodicea era overlapped):
	◦	Men are still called to repent and believe willingly.
	◦	The gospel is preached freely.
	◦	Obedience and disobedience are still, in that sense, voluntary.
	•	After the rapture (in the first half of the Tribulation):
	◦	Revelation 13 shows a system where worship is coerced:
	▪	“he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark…” (Rev. 13:16)
	▪	“and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.” (Rev. 13:15)
	◦	Worship of the beast becomes a matter of compulsion under threat of death.
So in this structure:
	•	The rapture ends the era of broad, voluntary gospel opportunity,
	•	but it does not automatically mean that no more believers can be saved, or that the entire “body” reality of the Church is instantly terminated at that moment.
The Bible presents the rapture as a catching away of saints and a deliverance from “the hour of temptation” (Rev. 3:10 for Philadelphia), but it does not explicitly state: “The Church age stops the instant the rapture happens.” That timing is a matter of prophetic arrangement and typology, not a direct quotation.

2. THE CHURCH-AGE BODY CONTINUES INTO THE FIRST HALF OF THE TRIBULATION
Within the prophetic framework of this book, the Church Age is understood as the entire span of the seven churches (Ephesus–Laodicea), including Laodicea’s unfinished story.
According to this structure:
	•	Philadelphia represents the kept, ready remnant that is removed before the hour of temptation (Rev. 3:10).
	•	Laodicea represents the lukewarm, undecided, yet beloved portion of the elect who are left and then awaken under pressure.
After the rapture, Scripture still shows:
	1	Saints on earth who come to faith and are slain for Christ
	◦	Revelation 20:4 — “…them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast…”
	◦	These are clearly believers after the beast system is active.
	2	Ongoing witness and preaching in the first half of the Tribulation
	◦	Revelation 11:3 — “And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days…” (1,260 days = 3½ years).
	◦	Their ministry overlaps the early part of the beast era.
	3	Jerusalem remains central
	◦	The holy city is trampled (Rev. 11:2).
	◦	The witnesses lie dead in “the great city” (Rev. 11:8).
	◦	The focus has swung back toward Israel and Jerusalem, but believing witnesses are still present.
In the typology of this study:
	•	Laodicea = the final daughter/church, still part of the wider “body” aspect of the Church Age,
	•	Philadelphia = the portion removed in the rapture,
	•	Laodicea = the portion awakened, chastened, and refined under Tribulation pressure.
Thus, while the rapture removes the ready church (Philadelphia), the Laodicean remnant continues into the first half of the Tribulation, coming to full obedience and sealing their testimony with martyrdom (linked with Rev. 13 and Rev. 20:4).
So in this framework:
	•	The Church-age body (understood as the seven-church structure) is still being dealt with by God during the first half of the Tribulation.
	•	The rapture marks separation within the Church—not yet the final termination of the Church-age framework.

3. THE MIDPOINT OF THE TRIBULATION — THE TRUE PROPHETIC END OF THE CHURCH AGE
Scripture clearly marks a midpoint in the final seven years by several major events:
	1	The Death of the Two Witnesses
	◦	Revelation 11:7–10 —
	▪	“when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast… shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.”
	▪	their bodies lie in the street,
	▪	the world rejoices over their death.
	2	A Great Earthquake in Jerusalem
	◦	Revelation 11:13 —
	▪	“And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell… and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.”
	3	The Beast’s Period of Full Authority
	◦	Revelation 13:5 —
	▪	“and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.” (the last 3½ years)
	◦	This aligns with the second half, when Satan’s dominion is most open and intense.
	4	The Awakening of a Remnant of Israel
	◦	Revelation 11:13 again — “the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.”
	◦	This is at least the beginning of a response from Israel, the first crack of repentance under fear and conviction.
In the prophetic structure of this study:
	•	The rapture removes Philadelphia and begins Laodicea’s chastening.
	•	The first half of the Tribulation includes:
	◦	Laodicea’s awakening and martyrdom,
	◦	the two witnesses testifying in Jerusalem for 1,260 days,
	◦	the final, overlapping witness to both Jew and Gentile.
	•	The midpoint (death of the witnesses, great earthquake, remnant giving glory, beast’s 42 months) is the real turning point.
At the midpoint:
	•	The last major witness to the nations (the two witnesses) is silenced.
	•	The remnant of Israel begins to respond in fear and glory to God (Rev. 11:13).
	•	Satan’s authority on earth becomes more direct and unrestrained (Rev. 13:5–7).
This turning point fits the cry of Habakkuk:
“O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.” — Habakkuk 3:2
In this prophetic arrangement:
	•	The Church Age, understood as the full seven-church structure (ending with Laodicea), effectively closes at the midpoint of the Tribulation:
	◦	Philadelphia has already been caught away.
	◦	Laodicea has been awakened, sifted, and martyred. (Rev 13:15)
	◦	The remaining focus shifts decisively to Israel and to the finishing of the mystery of God (cf. Rev. 10:7).
From that midpoint onward:
	•	Israel’s remnant rises into its final prophetic role,
	•	the beast’s dominion becomes fully open,
	•	and the last phase of wrath and mercy runs its course exactly as God has promised.
