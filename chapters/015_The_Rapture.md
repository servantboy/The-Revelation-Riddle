# CHAPTER 14 — THE RAPTURE

This chapter does not attempt to invent new doctrine about the rapture; instead, it gathers what Scripture actually says (KJV) and then places the rapture inside the prophetic structure already laid out in this book: the two days, the seven churches, and the daughters.

The word “rapture” does not appear in the King James Bible, but the event does:
- 1 Thessalonians 4:16–17 — “caught up together with them in the clouds”
- 1 Corinthians 15:51–52 — “we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed”

This chapter asks:  
**Where does that catching away stand in relation to the Church, Laodicea, and the Tribulation?**

## 1. THE RAPTURE DOES NOT BY ITSELF END THE CHURCH AGE

A common teaching in modern prophecy preaching is:
- “When the Church is raptured, God goes back to dealing with Israel.”
- “The Church age ends at the rapture.”

The King James Bible, however, never says:
- “The Church age ends at the rapture,” or
- “After the rapture, God is finished dealing with all Gentile believers.”

What we can say from Scripture is this:
- There will be a catching away of living saints (1 Thess. 4:16–17).
- There will be a resurrection and change “in a moment” (1 Cor. 15:51–52).
- There will be a time when worship of the beast is enforced and refusal means death (Rev. 13:15–17).

In the prophetic framework, the rapture marks a transition in how worship operates on earth:

### Before the rapture (Philadelphia & Laodicea era overlapped):
- Men are still called to repent and believe willingly.
- The gospel is preached freely.
- Obedience and disobedience are still, in that sense, voluntary.

### After the rapture:
Revelation 13 shows a system where worship is coerced:
- “he causeth all… to receive a mark…” (Rev. 13:16)
- “as many as would not worship the image… should be killed.” (Rev. 13:15)

Worship becomes a matter of compulsion under threat of death.

So in this structure:
- The rapture ends the era of broad, voluntary gospel opportunity,
- But it does **not** automatically mean no more believers can be saved,
- Nor does Scripture explicitly say: “The Church age stops the instant the rapture happens.”

The Bible presents the rapture as:
- A catching away of saints,
- A deliverance from “the hour of temptation” (Rev. 3:10),
- But does not state the exact moment the Church age ends.

## 2. THE CHURCH-AGE BODY CONTINUES INTO THE FIRST HALF OF THE TRIBULATION

Within this prophetic framework, the Church Age is the entire span of the seven churches (Ephesus–Laodicea), including Laodicea’s unfinished story.

According to this structure:
- **Philadelphia** represents the kept, ready remnant removed before the hour of temptation (Rev. 3:10; Malachi 3:17).
- **Laodicea** represents the lukewarm, undecided, yet beloved portion awakened under pressure (Malachi 3:18).

After the rapture, Scripture still shows:

### 1. Saints on earth who come to faith and are slain for Christ
Revelation 20:4 — beheaded saints who “had not worshipped the beast.”

### 2. Ongoing witness in the first half of the Tribulation
Revelation 11:3 —  
The two witnesses prophesy **1,260 days**.

### 3. Jerusalem remains central
- The holy city trampled (Rev. 11:2).
- The witnesses lie dead there (Rev. 11:8).

Thus:
- Laodicea continues into the first half of the Tribulation,
- Awakens under pressure,
- And seals its testimony with martyrdom (Rev. 13; Rev. 20:4).

In this model:
- **Philadelphia = removed in the rapture.**
- **Laodicea = sifted and refined under Tribulation pressure.**

Therefore:
- The rapture marks separation within the Church,
- But the **Church-age body** (in the seven-church typology) continues until Laodicea’s refining is complete.

## 3. THE MIDPOINT OF THE TRIBULATION — THE TRUE PROPHETIC END OF THE CHURCH AGE

Scripture marks a midpoint in the final seven years with several events:

### 1. The Death of the Two Witnesses
Revelation 11:7–10:
- The beast kills them,
- Their bodies lie in the street,
- The world rejoices.

### 2. A Great Earthquake in Jerusalem  
Revelation 11:13:
- “a great earthquake,”  
- “the tenth part of the city fell,”  
- “the remnant… gave glory to the God of heaven.”

### 3. The Beast’s Period of Full Authority  
Revelation 13:5:
- 42 months = last 3½ years.

### 4. The Awakening of a Remnant of Israel  
Revelation 11:13 —  
“the remnant… gave glory to the God of heaven.”

---

## In this prophetic structure:

- **The rapture removes Philadelphia.**
- **The first half of the Tribulation completes Laodicea’s chastening.**
- **The midpoint is the true turning point** — the end of the Church-age framework.

At the midpoint:
- The two witnesses are silenced,
- The remnant of Israel begins to respond,
- The beast’s authority becomes open and unrestrained.

Habakkuk 3:2 expresses this turning:
“O LORD… revive thy work in the midst of the years… in wrath remember mercy.”

### Thus:
- **Philadelphia** — caught away.
- **Laodicea** — awakened, sifted, martyred (Rev. 13:15).
- **Israel** — begins turning back to God.

From the midpoint forward:
- Israel takes center stage,
- The beast dominates outwardly,
- The final prophetic mysteries unfold exactly as God promised.
