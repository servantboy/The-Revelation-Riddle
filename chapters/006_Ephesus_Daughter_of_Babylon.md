# CHAPTER 5 — EPHESUS / THE DAUGHTER OF BABYLON

Ephesus represents the opening spiritual era of the Church Age. It stands at the beginning of the prophetic sequence, corresponding typologically to the head of gold in Daniel 2. This chapter preserves the literal meaning of Christ’s message while observing how the traits He identifies in Ephesus echo covenant patterns already established in Scripture—particularly those associated with the Daughter of Babylon, as spiritually reflected in Israel’s history.

## I. FULL KJV TEXT — REVELATION 2:1–7

1 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

2 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:

3 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.

4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.

5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

## II. TIME-OF-DAY POSITION — BEFORE SUNRISE OF DAY ONE
If the Church Age unfolds across two prophetic “days” (2 Pet. 3:8; Hos. 6:2), the era of Ephesus occupies the final portion of night before dawn on the first day.
In this period:

- the world remains largely in spiritual darkness,
- Israel is largely asleep to her Messiah,
- the light of the New Covenant has begun to rise but has not yet spread fully.

Ephesus reflects this moment of transition—faithful labor in the dark, clarity of doctrine, yet a cooling of affection. Dawn is near, but night has not fully lifted.

## III. METAL OF THE IMAGE — GOLD (THE HEAD)

Daniel’s image begins with the head of gold, representing Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar. Gold signifies:

- purity
- nobility
- kingship
- preeminence

Nebuchadnezzar alone among Israel’s oppressors is called “a king of kings” (Dan. 2:37). This title is not incidental. It forms a deliberate contrast with Christ, who is later revealed as KING OF KINGS (Rev. 19:16).

The image therefore establishes two heads:

- an earthly head who ruled through conquest and captivity,
- a heavenly Head who rules through resurrection and life.

Ephesus stands closest to Christ as the risen Head of the body (Col. 1:18), just as gold stands highest in the image.

## IV. THE FAITHFUL REMNANT IN EPHESUS

Christ’s opening words to Ephesus are commendation:

- labor without fainting,
- patience under pressure,
- intolerance of evil,
- discernment against false apostles.

This description fits a Jewish church in the generation preceding Christ’s resurrection—those who knew the Scriptures, and could test claims of authority.
The phrase “thou hast tried them which say they are apostles” indicates a verdict. Such testing presupposes proximity to apostolic authority and to Christ Himself, the Author and Judge (John 12:48). This cannot describe a later Gentile church removed from the apostolic age.

## V. THE UNFAITHFUL DAUGHTER — BABYLON’S SPIRITUAL SHADOW

In prophetic language, “Daughter of Babylon” refers first to Babylon’s own offspring (Isa. 47; Jer. 50–51). Yet Scripture also shows that Babylon’s captivity imprinted lasting spiritual patterns upon Israel.
Though the captivity ended, Babylon’s imprint did not vanish. It shifted from political dominance to spiritual oppression—visible in:

- confusion of authority,
- false claims to spiritual office,
- mixture of loyalties,
- drifting affection toward God.

This backdrop explains Christ’s rebuke:
“Because thou hast left thy first love.”
This charge only makes sense when addressed to a people who once loved rightly—Israel at the beginning of covenant relationship. It echoes the prophetic language of estrangement, not ignorance.

## VI. “REMEMBER FROM WHENCE THOU ART FALLEN”

This command further confirms the Jewish placement of Ephesus.
A Gentile church cannot be told to remember a covenantal height from which it fell. Israel can.
The warning also carries consequence:
“I will remove thy candlestick…”
Scripture interprets the candlestick as the visible witness (Rev. 1:20). Acts 13:46 records the historical fulfillment:
“Seeing ye put it from you… lo, we turn to the Gentiles.”
The light was not extinguished—it was transferred.

---

## VII. THE FATHER AND KING BEHIND THE PATTERN
Babylon stands as the father behind the Daughter of Babylon, and Nebuchadnezzar as the king who shaped her identity.
Nebuchadnezzar’s kingdom outlived him; his influence continued even after his fall. Likewise, Israel’s spiritual captivity outlasted Babylon’s political reign.
By contrast:

- Christ dies and rises,
- adopts the orphaned (Gal. 4:4–5),
- and remains the living Head of His people forever.

The contrast between these two kings anchors the opening of the Church Age.

## VIII. SUMMARY — WHY EPHESUS MUST STAND FIRST
The letter to Ephesus cannot represent a later era. It must stand at the time of Christ because:

- it addresses a Jewish church,
- it presupposes direct access to apostles,
- it renders verdict on false claimants,
- it calls Israel to remember covenant intimacy,
- and it announces the removal of the candlestick.

Ephesus marks the golden beginning—faithful in labor, sound in doctrine, yet cooling in affection. Beneath the literal message lies a prophetic pattern: the spiritual shadow of Babylon lingering over a people transitioning from old covenant night into new covenant dawn.
With the head established, the body may now descend.
The next chapter follows the church of Smyrna, where persecution replaces privilege and the light of dawn breaks into open conflict.
