CHAPTER 13 — THE SEVEN SEALS
THE SEVEN SEALS — THE PROMISES OF GOD (Revised & Strengthened — Final Version)
This chapter views the seven seals of Revelation not as random calamities, but as the covenant framework behind God’s dealings with the world. In this interpretation, the seals themselves are not the judgments; they are the promises, forces, and structures God has already set in place, which are then brought into the open before the day of His wrath fully unfolds.

1. A SEAL — MEANING IN SCRIPTURE
Across the Bible, seals signify:
	•	Promise / Covenant
	•	Identity
	•	Ownership
	•	Inheritance
	•	Authorization
	•	Protection
Examples:
	•	“…ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.” — Ephesians 1:13
	•	“Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.” — 2 Corinthians 1:22
	•	“Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.” — Isaiah 8:16
	•	“Seal up the book.” — Daniel 12:4
	•	“A book… sealed with seven seals.” — Revelation 5:1
The consistent biblical idea is that a seal:
	•	marks what belongs to God,
	•	protects what God has reserved,
	•	and holds something closed until His appointed time.
In this light, the seven seals of Revelation naturally fit the pattern of God’s covenant arrangements being opened and revealed.

2. THE SEALS DO NOT ACT — THEY REVEAL
This is the key observation in this framework:
The seals themselves are not described as performing the actions. When each seal is opened, we see something already at work.
	•	Seal 1: the rider conquers; the seal only reveals him.
	•	Seal 2: peace is taken; the rider takes it.
	•	Seal 3: food is measured; the voice speaks, the rider holds balances.
	•	Seal 4: Death and Hell kill; the seal unveils them.
	•	Seal 5: the souls are already slain when the seal opens.
	•	Seal 6: signs appear in heaven and earth; the seal reveals them.
	•	Seal 7: there is silence in heaven, and judgments proceed from what it contains.
The seals are therefore disclosures, not disasters. They unseal what God has already ordained. They bring into view forces and realities that have been present in redemptive history, now being shown in their prophetic order.
The seals function as the heavenly side of the same prophetic cycle described in the churches and metals—showing the covenant forces that span the same history.

3. THE SEVENTH SEAL SHOWS THE SEALS ARE NOT THEMSELVES JUDGMENTS
When the seventh seal is opened (Revelation 8:1):
	•	there is silence in heaven about the space of half an hour,
	•	there is no immediate plague named,
	•	and out of this seal come the seven trumpets.
Then:
	•	out of the seventh trumpet come the seven vials (bowls) of wrath.
This layered structure may be summarized:
	•	Seals – hold and reveal the covenant framework and forces.
	•	Trumpets – announce specific judgments.
	•	Vials – are the judgments being poured out.
In this view, the seals themselves are not the wrath; they are the opening of the book that contains both the warnings and the judgments to follow.

4. TWO OF THE SEALS ARE CLEARLY NOT LIMITED TO FUTURE EVENTS
Two seals plainly deal with realities that span all of history:
Seal 4 — Death & Hell
Revelation 6:8:
“And his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him…”
Death and Hell are not new characters appearing only in the Tribulation. They have been operating since sin entered the world (Romans 5:12). They are ongoing forces, now shown symbolically.
Seal 5 — The Martyrs
Revelation 6:9–10 shows:
	•	souls under the altar,
	•	already slain for the word of God,
	•	asking “How long… dost thou not judge and avenge our blood?”
Jesus connects the blood of the righteous from Abel onward in Matthew 23:35. The martyrs in view are not confined to a single brief era; they represent the historical company of those slain for God’s truth.
So:
	•	at least two seals clearly reveal longstanding conditions, not brand-new future forces.
	•	this strongly supports the idea that the seals show the big covenant forces of redemptive history, brought into prophetic sequence—not merely “one-time events” of a seven-year period.

5. THE BIBLE IDENTIFIES THE FOUR HORSEMEN IN ZECHARIAH
Before Revelation 6, colored horses appear in Zechariah.
A. Zechariah 1
Colors:
	•	red,
	•	speckled (or sorrel / pale),
	•	white.
They:
“walk to and fro through the earth” (Zech. 1:10–11),
reporting conditions. They survey; they do not initiate disasters.
B. Zechariah 6
Colors:
	•	white,
	•	red,
	•	black,
	•	grisled (or pale / spotted).
The angel interprets them:
“These are the four SPIRITS of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.” — Zechariah 6:5
Key points:
	•	They are called “four spirits of the heavens” – not random images.
	•	They go forth on assignments, in ordered directions (Zech. 6:6–7).
In this framework, those four spirits correspond to the four horsemen of Revelation 6, functioning as covenant administrators working throughout history, now displayed in prophetic sequence.

THE FOUR HORSEMEN — SPIRITUAL FORCES OF REDEMPTIVE HISTORY
PAIR 1 — The Northern / Heavenly Pair (White + Black)
In Zechariah 6, the horses linked to the north are associated with God’s judicial dealings. Typologically:
	•	White – associated with righteousness and victory.
	•	Black – associated with weighing, measuring, and famine.
The “north” is often linked with:
	•	the place of God’s rule (Ps. 48:2; Isa. 14:13),
	•	the direction from which judgment comes (Jer. 1:14–16).
In this reading:
	•	White represents Christ’s covenant conquest and redemption.
	•	Black represents God’s measured justice and assessment.
These two belong together: Christ redeems; God measures.
PAIR 2 — The Earthly Pair (Red + Pale)
The remaining horses work in the fallen earthly realm.
	•	Red – associated with bloodshed, war, and unrest; in this view, tied to sin and Satan’s dominion in the earth.
	•	Pale (grisled) – associated with death roaming the whole earth (Zech. 6:7).
These two form the second pair:
	•	Sin / unrest / war,
	•	followed by death and the grave.
This reflects a simple biblical chain:
“For the wages of sin is death…” — Romans 6:23
and:
“Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.” — James 1:15

SEAL #1 — THE WHITE HORSEMAN
The Promise of Redemption — Christ the Conquering King
Revelation 6:2:
“And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.”
Revelation 19:11–16 clearly identifies a rider on a white horse as Christ:
“…he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True… and on his head were many crowns… and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”
Scripture nowhere explicitly presents a counterfeit rider on a white horse by that name. In this framework, the rider of Revelation 6:2 is seen as:
	•	Christ going forth covenantually,
	•	conquering through the gospel and His redemptive work.
Symbol links in this interpretation:
	•	White – righteousness, purity, victory.
	•	Crown given – matches the giving of kingdom and authority to the Son (Dan. 7:14).
	•	Conquering – Christ conquers sin, Satan, and death (Col. 2:15; Heb. 2:14–15).
Here, Seal 1 is the promise of redemption unveiled: the covenant King rides out first in God’s plan.
(Note: This is an interpretive identification; the text of Revelation 6 does not name the rider, but the pattern of Scripture points strongly in this direction.)

SEAL #2 — THE RED HORSEMAN
The Promise of the Counter-Force — Sin / Satan’s Dominion
Revelation 6:4:
“And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth… and there was given unto him a great sword.”
This red horse recalls:
	•	the red horse in Zechariah 1:8–10, who walks to and fro through the earth,
	•	the adversary in Job 1:7, “from going to and fro in the earth,”
	•	and the dominion Satan claimed over the kingdoms of this world (Luke 4:6).
In this reading:
	•	“power was given unto him” reflects the dominion man forfeited at the Fall.
	•	“to take peace from the earth” matches the entrance of conflict and unrest after sin.
	•	“a great sword” echoes the destructive, false word opposed to the true sword of the Spirit (Eph. 6:17).
Thus Seal 2 reveals the counter-force to Christ’s conquest: the spiritual reality of sin and Satan’s dominion among men.

SEAL #3 — THE BLACK HORSEMAN
The Promise of Measured Judgment — Justice that Spares the Redeemed
Revelation 6:5–6:
“…and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand… A measure of wheat for a penny… and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.”
Balances in Scripture are associated with:
	•	God’s just measurement (Job 31:6),
	•	honest weights (Hosea 12:7),
	•	and judgment (Dan. 5:27, “Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting”).
Habakkuk 3 pictures the Lord:
“…didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation.” (Hab. 3:8)
within a context of shaking, famine, and yet salvation for the faithful.
Key features here:
	•	Balances – divine justice and evaluation.
	•	A voice from the midst of the four beasts (Rev. 6:6) – from the throne, indicating God speaks, not the adversary.
	•	“Hurt not the oil and the wine” – in this reading, the anointing (oil) and covenant blood (wine) of Christ’s people must not be harmed.
So Seal 3 pictures measured judgment:
	•	real scarcity and weighing,
	•	but a boundary that protects the essentials of the redeemed.

SEAL #4 — THE PALE HORSEMAN
The Promise of the Final Consequence — Death and the Grave
Revelation 6:8:
“…a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him…”
This is the end of the sequence:
	•	White – Christ and redemption,
	•	Red – sin and conflict,
	•	Black – divine weighing and judgment,
	•	Pale – death and the grave.
As James puts it:
“Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.” — James 1:15
Death and Hell have been active since the earliest Biblical record of murder (Cain and Abel) and the universal reign of death (Rom. 5:12–14).
Seal 4 is the revelation that sin’s final wage is and always has been death, with Hell in its train.

SEAL #5 — THE MARTYRS
The Promise of Vindication — “How Long, O Lord?”
Revelation 6:9–11:
	•	shows souls under the altar,
	•	slain for the word of God and their testimony,
	•	crying, “How long… dost thou not judge and avenge our blood…?”
Important implications:
	•	Judgment has not yet begun in full: they are asking when it will come.
	•	The seals are leading up to judgment, not pouring it out.
	•	The martyrs represent a company that stretches back through history (cf. Luke 11:50–51; Matt. 23:35).
Jesus speaks of God avenging His elect who cry day and night (Luke 18:7–8).
So Seal 5 is the promise that:
	•	God will not forget their blood,
	•	He will answer their cry in His own time,
	•	vindication is guaranteed, even if delayed.

SEAL #6 — THE PROMISE OF COMING JUDGMENT
The Universal Warning Before Wrath
Revelation 6:12–17:
	•	the sun becomes black,
	•	the moon as blood,
	•	stars fall,
	•	heaven departs as a scroll,
	•	men of all ranks hide from “the wrath of the Lamb.”
This “sun, moon, stars” language appears repeatedly in the prophets:
	•	Joel 2:31,
	•	Isaiah 13:10; 34:4,
	•	echoed by Jesus in Matthew 24:29 and Peter in Acts 2:20.
In each case, the cosmic signs are warnings that the day of the Lord is near. They serve as a last call before the hammer falls.
In this view:
	•	Seal 6 is not the wrath itself; it is the global alarm that wrath is imminent,
	•	it immediately precedes the sealing of God’s servants in Revelation 7,
	•	it functions like the prophetic “darkened heavens” language that always points to judgment at the door.
Enoch the Seventh from Adam
Jude 14 notes:
“Enoch also, the seventh from Adam…”
“Seventh” stands at the threshold before judgment in that line, just as:
	•	Enoch is taken before the Flood,
	•	Revelation 7’s sealing and deliverance come before the trumpet judgments,
	•	the opening of the seventh seal leads directly into the day of the Lord.
Scripture does not state this pattern in so many words, but the parallels form a consistent picture: a people are sealed or removed just before wrath begins.
Revelation 7:3 and 2 Peter 3:7 — Mirror Image.
Revelation 7:3:
“Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God…”
2 Peter 3:7:
“…the heavens and the earth, which are now… are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment…”
Both passages stress:
	•	restraint before judgment,
	•	the world held back from harm until God’s servants or His purposes are ready,
	•	the certainty that judgment will come in His time.
Seal 6 is therefore the final warning before God’s restraining hand is partly lifted and judgment proceeds.

SEAL #7 — THE PROMISE OF JUDGMENT FULFILLED
(2 Peter 3:9–10)
Revelation 8:1:
“And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven…”
This solemn silence precedes the sounding of the trumpets and the beginning of explicit, named plagues.
This aligns with 2 Peter 3:
	•	“The Lord is not slack concerning his promise… but is longsuffering… not willing that any should perish” (v. 9),
	•	yet “the day of the Lord will come” (v. 10).
In this structure:
	•	Seals 1–6 – reveal the covenant forces and give warning.
	•	Seal 7 – opens the way for the trumpet and vial judgments: the promised day finally arrives.
Thus Seal 7 stands as the doorway between God’s prolonged patience and the actual outpouring of His wrath.

CONCLUSION — THE SEALS AS GOD’S PROMISE FRAMEWORK
In this interpretation, the seven seals tell the whole story of God’s promises and dealings from Genesis to Revelation:
	1	Seal 1 — Redemption Christ goes forth conquering, the covenant King of salvation.
	2	Seal 2 — Sin’s Dominion The fallen, red condition of the earth under the adversary’s sway.
	3	Seal 3 — Divine Justice God weighs and measures, but protects the anointing and the blood.
	4	Seal 4 — Death Sin’s final wage, with Hell following, as it has from the beginning.
	5	Seal 5 — Martyrs The righteous suffer and cry for vindication across the ages.
	6	Seal 6 — Warning Cosmic signs and terror among men announce that the day is at hand.
	7	Seal 7 — Judgment Silence falls; the trumpets and vials come forth; the long-promised day of the Lord arrives.
This is the arc of Scripture:
	•	Christ goes forth (white).
	•	Sin rises and resists (red).
	•	God weighs and measures (black).
	•	Death follows (pale).
	•	The righteous are slain (martyrs).
	•	Warnings multiply (signs).
	•	Judgment finally falls (Day of the Lord).
The seals, then, are not random calamities. They are the covenant blueprint—the spiritual architecture of redemptive history—unsealed before God’s judgments are poured out on a world that has resisted His promises and rejected His Son.
